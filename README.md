# Outline:

- A very basic world-time app where the user can choose a city from a list of locations and then be shown the 12 hour time in that city using the [WorldTime API](http://worldtimeapi.org/timezones).
- The app has 3 main pages:
    - A home page where the time, location name, country flag as well as a changing background image based on the time of day are displayed.

    - A location page where the user can change the location for which they want the data.

    - A loading page that is displayed when the app starts up, it consists of a spinner widget built using the flutter_spinkit package.

# Purpose:

- I've always been extremely interested in the seemingly magical process through whichs apps are conjured and when I heard about Flutter, a framework through which I could build cross platform apps using just one codebase, I was extremely intrigued.
- Using the [helpful beginner course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ) by NetNinja, I slowly came to grips with the basics of the framework and in the course, we built a very simply time app, which I tweaked slightly in this repository.
- The language dart, was a lot more inviting that I had initially expected and it came easily to me given my experience in OOP through python and java.
- After more research into app-making with Flutter, I realise that I am not even scratching the tip of the iceberg with this application and am looking to learn how to use packages such as Firebase to make more useful apps and incorporate databases through Firestore and sqflite3.
