# Outline:

- A very basic world-time app where the user can choose a city from a list of locations and then be shown the 12 hour time in that city using the [WorldTime API](http://worldtimeapi.org/timezones).
- The app has 3 main pages:
    - A home page where the time, location name, country flag as well as a changing background image based on the time of day are displayed.
